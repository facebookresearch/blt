class MultiprocessIterator(StatefulIterator):
    """
    Design sketch of the multiprocess iterator:

    Given the base_iterator, the only thing we do with this is call get_state()
    so that we can pass that through to the background worker process.

    The background process will receive this, rebuild the iterator, then start yielding from it.

    However, in order to implement MultiprocessIterator.get_state(), we need to be able to accurately get
    (1) the state of the iterator in the worker process
    (2) the currently buffered items in the Queue

    To do this, we use:
    - batch_queue: This is the prefetch buffer the worker yields to and the main loop yields from
    - state_queue: This size 1 queue will be how the worker sends the iterator state once it has halted iterating.
        It must hold the state in addition to the last batch, if the queue was full at the time the stop event is sent.
    - stop_iterating_event: Once this is issued from the main loop, the worker will stop iterating and enter cleanup.
        During cleanup, the iterator will send the state of the current iterator to the main loop,
        in addition to possibly the last batch if the batch_queue was full at the time
    - state_dumped_event: When the main loop issues the stop_iterating_event, it will wait until the state_dumped_event to attempt
        to get state from the state_queue. It must do this since the worker may take some time to create and send the state.
        Once received by the main loop, the main loop can safely store the Queue (plus maybe the last batch) as the prefetch buffer,
        get the worker iterator's state, and terminate the background process + delete associated objects.

    At this point, calling create_iter() again will bootstrap everything from the stored state and the old iterator will throw an error
    since it will not iterate anymore (so the caller must call create_iter() again to get a python iterator).
